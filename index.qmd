__Robotics Engineer, PhD__

<u>E-mail:</u> maxime.noizet.ch@gmail.com

I graduated with an engineering degree in Computer Science from the **Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC)**, with a specialization in real-time systems and embedded computing.

Following my graduation, I worked for one year as a **Research Engineer** at the **Heudiasyc Laboratory**, where I contributed to research on localization integrity and statistical distribution approximation. This work was conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Philippe Xu](https://www.hds.utc.fr/~xuphilip) and [Dr. Jean-Benoist Léger](https://www.hds.utc.fr/~legerjea/).

I then pursued a Ph.D. at the [Heudiasyc Laboratory](https://www.hds.utc.fr/) within the **SyRI (Robotic Systems in Interaction)** team. I was also a member of **SIVALab**, a joint laboratory between [Heudiasyc](https://www.hds.utc.fr), [UTC](https://utc.fr) / [CNRS](https://cnrs.fr), and the [Renault Group](https://www.renaultgroup.com/). My Ph.D. was supervised by [Dr. Philippe Xu](https://www.hds.utc.fr/~xuphilip) and [Prof. Philippe Bonnifait](https://www.hds.utc.fr/~bonnif), and focused on the following topic:

> **Multi-Sensor Perception with Vector Maps for Autonomous Vehicle Localization**

This research was part of the European project [ERASMO: Enhanced Receiver for Autonomous MObility](https://erasmo-gnss.eu/).

Currently, I am employed as a **CNRS Research Engineer** at the **Heudiasyc Laboratory**, continuing my work on perception with vector maps for autonomous vehicle localization, extending the research I conducted during my Ph.D.
